The false inputs resulted in multiple powerhouse line protection misoperations and the unnecessarily tripping of hundreds of megawatts of generation. Due to the vintage of the equipment and a failure of the relay to properly log events, little data was initially available for troubleshooting. The powerhouse line relays at both the substation and powerhouse were owned and operated by the TOP but were connected to and powered by the GOP’s control circuits and battery at the powerhouse."}
{"question":"For NERC Lessons Learned LL20210202 (Date: 2/10/2021, Category: General Processes), what summary does the Quick Reference Guide provide?","answer":"The entity was adding a source of backup power to their primary system operating center (PSOC). Considerable movement of people and materials in and out of critical infrastructure protection (CIP) controlled areas occurred as contract workers had to install equipment and route cable. The contract construction workers had background checks and had been trained on the access procedure. After several access violations had been noted, a work stand-down was declared, and security expertise from one of the entity’s nuclear stations was contacted for consultation. The security consultant used Barrier Analysis to determine the effectiveness of access control and logging at the PSOC. The consultant found that shortcuts bypassing the expected path had been used to move material from an outside laydown area and that barriers that should have prevented this were ineffective. There were access procedure weaknesses identified as well."}

{"question":"For NERC Lessons Learned LL20201101 (Date: 11/12/2020, Category: Transmission Facilities, Bulk Power System Operations), what summary does the Quick Reference Guide provide?","answer":"When a SF6 circuit breaker (CB) hits its critical low pressure, its fault interrupting capability can be compromised. Most TOs protect against this by either auto-opening the CB prior to reaching the critical low-pressure level or by blocking the CB from tripping (when it reaches the critical low-pressure level) and relying on adjacent CBs to open in the event of a fault (breaker failure mode). If this occurs across multiple locations, it can place the Bulk Electric System (BES) at additional risk since it weakens the overall topology of the system and can result in more facilities being removed from service to clear a fault. It also means that the contingencies modeled and studied in real-time contingency analysis (RTCA) studies may no longer be accurate, thereby potentially putting the BES in a less secure or unknown state. That condition occurred during the severe cold weather event that hit the upper Midwest region of North America on January 29–30, 2019."}

{"question":"For NERC Lessons Learned LL20200703 (Date: 7/30/2020, Category: Relaying and Protection Systems), what summary does the Quick Reference Guide provide?","answer":"Unnecessary trips for nonfault conditions are problematic for any protective relay and can be particularly problematic for lockout relays. Lockout relays are typically used to isolate and hold BES electrical equipment out of service for extended periods of time to allow for visual inspection and typically result in the operation of multiple interrupting devices. Many lockout relay types require manual reset, meaning that field personnel must travel to the relay location, inspect, and perform switching to restore systems to service. The resulting extended abnormal operating condition of the system may put the reliability of the BES at risk."}
{"question":"For NERC Lessons Learned LL20200702 (Date: 7/30/2020, Category: Relaying and Protection Systems), what summary does the Quick Reference Guide provide?","answer":"Failure to employ effective commissioning testing practices or effective quality checks of protection system designs when installing or modifying protection systems can lead to protection system misoperations. These can occur with all components of protection systems, but issues with voltage and current instrument transformer wiring regularly surface when protection system misoperations occur. Protection system misoperations have an immediate negative impact on the reliability of the bulk power system and may cause a significant increase in the magnitude and scope of a disturbance. It should be noted that this lessons learned document is an expanded version of the NERC lesson learned document titled “Verification of AC Quantities during Protection System Commissioning” that was issued on March 11, 2014.

{"question":"For NERC Lessons Learned LL20200701 (Date: 7/10/2020, Category: Relaying and Protection Systems), what summary does the Quick Reference Guide provide?","answer":"Multiple composite protection system misoperations have occurred on the Bulk Electric System (BES) as a result of mixing protective relay technologies at the remote terminals of directional comparison blocking (DCB) schemes. One of the most challenging mix of technologies is utilizing a relay system based on newer microprocessors (µP) at one terminal and an older electromechanical (EM) relay system at the opposite terminal. Utilizing different models of µP based relays at each terminal can also be problematic. Often, only one terminal of a DCB system is upgraded to µP based relays due to various reasons, including different ownership of terminals, budget constraints, and emergency replacements. Relay timing and directional coordination is critical in DCB schemes that may be overlooked when relay technology or relay models vary between terminals."}

{"question":"For NERC Lessons Learned LL20151201 (Date: 12/29/2015, Category: Bulk Power System Operations), what summary does the Quick Reference Guide provide?","answer":"A breaker fault on a shunt reactor of a high-voltage transmission line caused the line to trip. This event led to the exceedance of two interconnection reliability operating limits. Immediate actions were taken to clear those exceedances within the required 30 minutes. However, the involved interfaces have both a system operating limit and an interconnection reliability operating limit. This caused the transmission system operator to misinterpret the information by not noticing that the flows were still above the system operating limits while the interconnection reliability operating limit exceedances were being addressed. Since the transmission system operator confused the two limits, the operator proceeded to manually shed load in an attempt to return the flows back to within what was believed to be interconnection reliability operating limit values but were really system operating limits. This occurred 28 minutes after the start of the event."}
