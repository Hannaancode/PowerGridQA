# PowerGridQA: A Structured Question–Answer Benchmark for Power System Dynamics and Grid Operations

**PowerGridQA** is the first large-scale, verified question–answer dataset designed to train, evaluate, and benchmark large language models (LLMs) for reasoning in **power system dynamics, operations, and reliability**.  
It integrates data from textbooks, operational standards (NERC Lessons Learned), and reasoning-based synthetic cases, enabling both academic and industrial use in LLM fine-tuning, RAG pipelines, and intelligent grid assistants.
